This repository is a study project called **Pokedex**, built with modern web technologies to create an interactive Pok√©dex. The goal is to explore the integration of these tools in a real-world application, allowing users to search, view, and explore information about different Pok√©mon.

## üìå About

**Pokedex** was created for educational purposes to study and implement:

- **Next.js** (App Router) for the React framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Zustand** for global state management
- **TanStack Query** for asynchronous data fetching and caching
- **shadcn/ui** for accessible UI components

The goal is to understand how these technologies work together in a Pok√©dex-inspired application.
