This repository is a study project called **Pokedex**, built with modern web technologies to create an interactive Pok√©dex. The goal is to explore the integration of these tools in a real-world application, allowing users to search, view, and explore information about different Pok√©mon.

## üìå About

**Pokedex** was created for educational purposes to study and implement:

- **Next.js** (App Router) for the React framework
- **Tailwind CSS** for utility-first styling
- **Zustand** for global state management
- **TanStack Query** for asynchronous data fetching and caching
- **tRPC** for end-to-end typesafe APIs
- **shadcn/ui** for accessible UI components

The goal is to understand how these technologies work together in a Pok√©dex-inspired application.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - The React Framework for Production
- [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) - A utility-first CSS framework
- [Zustand](https://github.com/pmndrs/zustand) - A small, fast and scalable state management solution
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query/latest) - Powerful asynchronous state management and data fetching
- [tRPC](https://trpc.io/) - End-to-end typesafe APIs made easy
- [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/) - Beautifully designed components built with Radix UI and Tailwind CSS
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - Strongly typed JavaScript

## ‚ú® Features
